# Queue-Management-System-in-Hospitals-DSA-simulation
The Hospital Patient Queue Management System is a Windows-based GUI application developed using C++ and the Win32 API. The project is designed to simulate how hospitals manage patient queues by separating them into Normal and Emergency categories, ensuring that critically ill patients are attended first.
